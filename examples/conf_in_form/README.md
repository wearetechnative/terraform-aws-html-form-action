# HTML Form Action Example - Emails configured in HTML

> Configuration of mail addresses in the form is discouraged. Better configure
> them in Terraform.

This example shows how to configure a form endpoint and configure the email
addresses inside the Form HTML.

You can test the local form with a simple local webserver:

```
cd examples/conf_in_tf_with_response_mail
python -m http.server
```

Open [http://localhost:8000/form_index.html](http://localhost:8000/form_index.html) in your browser.
